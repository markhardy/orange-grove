                It can be impossible to find the right off the shelf software to tackle the unique problems 
                faced by most political organizations.
            </h1>

            <h2 class="orange">
                Let's face it. Political organizations make up a tiny percentage of the enterprise market. Software 
                vendors find it much more lucrative to target the enterprise market at large.

                        not a bandaid that breaks at scale five years down the road. Professional software 
                        development is crucial when it comes to long term scalability.

                        going to result in a long term solution? Will it scale? Why is our monthly cloud bill so 
                        high? Can someone look under the hood and recommend some measures to save money?
