                It can be impossible to find the right off the shelf software to tackle the unique problems 
                faced by most political organizations.
            </h1>

            <h2 class="orange">
                Let's face it. Political organizations make up a tiny percentage of the enterprise market. Software 
                vendors find it much more lucrative to target the enterprise market at large.

                        an eye for scalability and making certain the software we hand off is a long term win and 
                        not a bandaid that breaks at scale five years down the road. Professional software 
                        development is crucial when it comes to long term scalability.

                        Is there a cheaper way of doing this that gets the same result? Is this development plan 
                        going to result in a long term solution? Will it scale? Why is our monthly cloud bill so 
                        high? Can someone look under the hood and recommend some measures to save money?
